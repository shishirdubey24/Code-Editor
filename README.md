page.js file deleted from app/ folder and made a new folder under app with name root with () if we dont
place () so it wont work (reason currently dont know)
2:: then inside(root)/components and create page.jsx file here it will render all the componennts inside it
as like we does with app.jsx into react ..
3:: page.**_ file is very IMP for rendering the components (specific to UI)
layout._** file is used to render all the routes and routes have different structer from compoenets.
all the routes have their own layout filewhihc shows the UI their specific UI does not lie inside Components

4:: structer of route is app/ route (folder)/layout.jsx ,page.jsx the UI of specific route will be called inside its page ::> route will have 2 files 1.UI(named as layout)
2.Renerding page(page file)

Now lets move to Header.jsx file
1:: Get the User from Db //currently commented due to no knowledge
2::we are just making the UI part By copy pasting so first create div give classes then again div +classes then give logo +hover effectm (that blue box abpve right corner)
